1. INTRODUCTION

JImage Mosaic is a program which allows you to make photomosaic
images.  Photomosaics are large images that are made from several
smaller tile images.  Currently, JImage Mosaic is in its alpha2
release form.  This means that there are still several bugs that
need to be worked out, and several functions do not even exist
yet.  JImage Mosaic will be a highly extensible program, allowing
developers to create their own rendering/evaluating/saving
plugins.

2. INSTALLATION

Installation of JImage Mosaic is fairly simple, provided that
you have already downloaded the JRE and JAI packages from
java.sun.com (See REQUIREMENTS section for more info.)

	WINDOWS:
	
		Simply un-zip the file into your desired
		directory (making sure you maintain the
		directory structure).
		Next, just run the .BAT file included with
		the package by double-clicking on 
		JImageMosaic.BAT.
		OR, you can go to a command prompt and
		type:
			java MainForm

	LINUX:

		For linux distributions, just copy the
		downloaded file into the appropriate directory,
		and unzip/untar it, by typing:
			tar -zxvf JImageMosaic_0.2alpha_bin.tar.gz
		This should decompress JImage Mosaic, maintaining
		the directory structure.  To execute JImage Mosaic,
		just type:
			./JImageMosaic
		in the directory you installed to, to run the
		shell script.  Or, you can just type:
			java MainForm		

	MAC:
		
		There currently aren't any files that are
		easily executable for the Macs to run
		JImage Mosaic.  But, you can download and
		decompress any of the disributions, and
		run the Java class MainForm to start running
		JImage Mosaic.  I've also been informed that Sun
		has not yet released JAI for the Mac.  I'm not
		sure if there is a 3rd party JAI substitute.  I'd
		appreciate an email if anyone is able to get
		JImage Mosaic working on a Mac. jimage-mosaic@jimdrewes.com


	SOURCE CODE:

		To actually compile the source code, you need to
		download the J2SE 1.4 SDK, as well as the JDK for
		JAI 1.1.1_01.  Then, to compile the code, do:
			javac *.java imageUtils/*.java plugins/*.java plugins/saveTypes/*.java

3. REQUIREMENTS

To run JImage Mosaic, you have to have Java's Runtime
Environment (JRE 1.4) installed, as well as Java's JAI
API.  These are both available for download for free from
Sun's servers.  If you aren't sure if you already have Java
installed, go to a command/shell prompt, and type:
	java -version
If the version is 1.4.0_01 or higher, you are okay.  But you'll
probably still have to install JAI.  The following are links
to the files you need to download to install Java and JAI:
	JRE 1.4 (J2SE)
		http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/download.html
			(note:  Download the JDK, not the SDK)
	JAI 1.1.1_01
		http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/jai/downloads/download.html
			(note: Download from the JRE box, not any of the others)

Other than that, all you need is to download and install the JImage Mosaic
binaries, per the instructions in the INSTALLATION section.

Hardware-wise, to get decent performance, you need a reasonable amount of RAM
(128MB), and a decent processor (1Gz or more).  Also, faster hard drives and
better video cards also should speed up performance.  Even though these are
recommended specs, you can probably run JImage Mosaic with lower hardware.
